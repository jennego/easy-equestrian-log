# easy-equestrian-log
log in your rides with as little typing and effort as possible

First project with vite

Because I wanted to restart this habit but it seemed like too much work.


## Planned features

- mobile first interface
- tap/click your selections
- you can type if you want to
- add media 
- view your log and data in various ways
- theme switcher (at least light/dark)
- one day I will figure out how to make a friggin offline pwa
